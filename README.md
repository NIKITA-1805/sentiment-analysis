# Sentiment Analysis

This project is a sentiment analysis web application built with Streamlit that classifies Amazon product reviews as positive or negative using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization. It includes tools to preprocess raw text data, visualize sentiment distribution, and make real-time predictions from user input. The app supports large datasets with sampling options for efficient development and testing.

The raw dataset is sourced from Kaggle and converted using a custom script for streamlined model training and deployment.

## üì¶ Dataset

The original dataset is **not included** in this repository due to its size.

You can download it from Kaggle:  
üîó [Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)

After downloading, place the following files in your project directory:

- `train.txt`
- `test.txt`

Then run:

```bash
python dataTransform.py
```

This script will merge and convert the data into a CSV file named `reviews.csv`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Large data files like `train.txt`, `test.txt`, and `reviews.csv` have been deleted from the repo.
- To recreate them, use the Kaggle link and `dataTransform.py`.
- Temporary files (e.g., `.pkl`) are not included in version control.
